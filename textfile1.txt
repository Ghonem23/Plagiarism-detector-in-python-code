April 10, 2020, The dramatic increase in online courses due to the coronavirus pandemic seems to have led to a corresponding dramatic increase in the use of Moss over the last few weeks. (It's not clear why these two things should be related, but it appears they are.) The public server has been moved to a larger machine (more cores and more memory), which should help meet the increased demand. Difficulties connecting to the server or receiving results are a sign that the server is overloaded at that time; please try again later. All users are asked to limit submissions to no more than 100/day.
